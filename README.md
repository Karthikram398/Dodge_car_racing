# Dodge_car_racing


Game creation in any programming language is very rewarding.The computer uses the Cartesian coordinate system to plot graphics. The scope of the project is to develop a 2d car gameby a better understanding of computer graphics being taught that is by using a coordinate system, display (pixels array),fps,and GUI. The system shall use the GUI, developed by the pygame module. This project will be built in python. Frame rate, flip, Blit(background),and hovering elements over the GUI (illusion) being used.This Project can be developed by 3D games and kinematics for steering.
This project can be further developed by using reinforcement learning by using the action-value function to let the computer play the game without user interaction to make graphics easier to work with, we will use “Pygame".

Pygame makes simple to:
Draw graphic shapes
•Display bitmapped images
•Animate
•Interact with keyboard, mouse, and gamepad
•Play sound
•Detect when objects collide


Project overview:

1.I will run thegame on ‘pygame’and later can be converted to executable files where a player not having python IDLE can also cherish the gameusing ‘Cxfreeze’

2.Usage of basic python concepts:
•Loops
•Function
•Conditional statements


Player’s car ->The car that player can control
Opponents ->The cars thatplayersneed to be dodgedby the user.These carsact asan obstacle for a player.
Road->The racing road which can, limiting the border for player
Score->Showing the current scores of the player’s cars
Background->The background picture making the game more real
